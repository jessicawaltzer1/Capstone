   <h3>I am a senior at Oakland Technical Highschool and have been going here since freshman year. I've been interested in the topic of dreams for as long as I can remember. I've always had crazy dreams containing random people, places, and situations. These whimsical dreams led me to my capstone question: <I>"What is the relationship between dreams and subconcious feelings of stress?"</I> </h3>
